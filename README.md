# Basic Todo List App with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I created and developed this project when I was learning React. This allowed me to quickly gain skills in react development.

## Project content

The functionalities developed in this basic application are:

* Add a new task
* Edit task
* Delete task
* Mark a task as completed

* Filter by completed tasks; incompleted tasks or by has due date
* Sort tasks by added date or due date

## Note

No Backend; data is stored in local storage.

Routes are handled manually; no package (such as react-router) was used!

## Design

The app is built with a beautiful template.
